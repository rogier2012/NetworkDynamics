James became the first British lead artist to hold the top spot on the chart for more than one week this year  and was also confirmed as the best-selling British singles artist in 2016.  \u9e93Say You Won\u9e93t Let Go\u9e93 has quickly become a worldwide hit  having topped iTunes  Spotify  Shazam and official singles charts around the globe.\n \n\u9e93You\u9e93ve got to founder if you\u9e93re scared of your own feelings.\u9e93 Say You Won\u9e93t Let Go tells the moving story of a love  which nearly would\u9e93ve been defeated by fear of permitting emotions.
